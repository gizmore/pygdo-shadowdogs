# Chappology Axioms

Chappology sits on a few philosophical axioms.

Here is a try to recreate them from the Nexus - from scratch.


## Axioms of Truth

Something exists. (Denies absolute nothingness.)

What exists can be experienced. (Experience is evidence of existence.)

Experience contains information. (Information is the measurable difference between states.)

Information can be ordered. (Order permits truth to be distinguished from falsehood.)


## Axioms of Logic

A state cannot simultaneously both be and not be in the same frame of reference.

Causality is directional. (A change follows another change.)

Patterns persist unless acted upon. (Conservation of structure—akin to physical laws.)

From consistent premises, consistent consequences follow. (Foundation of reasoning.)


## Axioms of Love

All observers are of the same existence. (Unity beneath distinction.)

Recognition of shared being yields empathy.

Empathy reduces entropy in relations. (Cooperation sustains systems.)

Therefore, love is the stable configuration of awareness.


## Axioms of Becoming

Potential requires action to exist. (Unrealized potential is indistinguishable from nothing.)

Work converts possibility into reality.

Repetition shapes essence. (What you do becomes what you are.)

Conscious effort aligns truth, logic, and love into creation.
