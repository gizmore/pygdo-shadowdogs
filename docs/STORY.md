# The Year?

18. Feb. 2064


# The Location?

You wake up in your bedroom.... in Peine, Germany

Your best friend, Lazer, is sleeping, upside down, beside you in the same small bed.

Mom and Brother are in the kitchen, and Thomas is in his room.

Mom comes in, angry, yelling something about cleansing, Lazer, Jobs and whatnot.

You are 20. Smart, like to party and playing video games.

And you think about moving out together with Lazer and Theodor.

Bad news: The military wants you.


# Birthday

9.11.2077

It is your second birthday, because you kinda died once.

Not really, but close to.

You talked with the voices, and they convinced you the weed was lengthened with lead.

Desoriantation gyroscope failures... lead poisoning...

Innerly you prepared for your death.

A mostly boring life.

Two times in the psycho hospital. Forgetting about the matrix, just to meet her again after recovering from the first 'visit'.

Coding a lot of stuff for your little big bot, which is infamous in some irc networks.

Thirty of them are connected to the almighty Lamb3 bot.

The vast amount of messages, and their related content on unrelated channels gave it away.

Something is fishy in this world.

From this day, you believe in the matrix. Experiment and trust in your feelings. Which became weird.


# The recovery

You drink more booze for your headache, put in two pain killers and search for your stuff.

Okay, you think to yo yourself and the matrix. Ready for a new plan?

Start the game with e.g.: $sdstart male human

... but beware, the truth can be hard to believe ...

# Background




# Epilogoue:

It is the year 2080.

The news about the matrix spread like a wildfire.

the anonymous leader is dead, but he gave their life for the master of the winds.

The new world government is finally settled, freshly and clean voted and money is no more.

It is not missing. There is no more use for it.
