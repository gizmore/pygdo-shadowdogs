## Day of the DOG GOD

 - 4th May

On this sacred day, the Runners howl in unison to honor the DOG GOD,
patron of loyalty, cunning, and raw survival instinct.
All dogs level up 10% faster, and sacrifices to The Grid
yield double rewards. Remember: you are not the master's pet —
you are the DOG GOD’s chosen.

May conflict with day of the starwors force.

This day was the day when two neighbours clashed.
The outcome was pretty beautiful, as they all became true friends.
The high society honored us with another holiday.
