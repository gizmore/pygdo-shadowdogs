During our journey we mastered a lot of lessons.

Each of them shall be a holiday in the new world order.


## Day of the DOG GOD

 - 4th May

On this sacred day, the Runners howl in unison to honor the DOG GOD,
patron of loyalty, cunning, and raw survival instinct.
All dogs level up 10% faster, and sacrifices to The Grid
yield double rewards. Remember: you are not the master's pet —
you are the DOG GOD’s chosen.

May conflict with day of the starwors force.
