# ESL Law

These are the rules of the ESL, when accepted as a country in the world.

We try to keep it simple, and this document may only be changed by effective votes.

Of course, citizens have a veto.

I first thought about patching an existent country set of laws,
but germany sucks and i don't know other countries much, so...
let us start fresh.


## Rights

 - You have the right of free food.
 - You have the right of 20NY/h wage.
 - 

## Deeds

 - You can be told todo labour of 8h/week for no compensation, except your rights.
 - You may not leave the path or the way. This means ethical thinking and acting.
