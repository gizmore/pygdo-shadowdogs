``# Hacking Minigame

This is the shadowdogs hacking minigame.

In your Home you can `#hack computer`.

Inside the game try `#x move r` twice.


## Rulez

- The game field is X*3 cells "high" `.`.
- Fog of war tiles are rendered `#`.
- You start at a random field `S` with your icon being a `P`.
- The main vault, a green `$`, will allow exit.exe to run.
- Sinks `v` will log you out with damage.
- Passwords `ยง` will log you out with 4 damage and eat up all your cpu and scramble your map unless you have the pass.
- if your cpu power goes below zero you will get damage (rand(max(0,amt_below_zero-hacking), amt_below_zero+1)
- if you move out of the map you get 2 damage and log you out.
- cpu power recovers slowly, but only outside the hacking attempts.
- Traps (ring) `0`-`3` deal damage and cost cpu cycles.
You will get moved to the start or your last backdoor.
Your backdoor will be gone.
If you had a backdoor, the trap will not reposition.
- `0`: 3 dmg 10cc
- `1`: 2 dmg  8cc
- `2`: 1 dmg  6cc
- `3`: 0 dmg  4cc
- Wall `W` just blocks your way.
