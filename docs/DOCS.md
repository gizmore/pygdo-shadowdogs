## Combat

The combat happens in real time and actions can be done.
Every player has a one item stack,

The default command is `$sdattack <rand>`, locking a random target.

Items and equipment can be used and changed, but it costs time.

### Executables

Hacking executables are like magic spells but don't require time.
There are randomly N executables started, based on your hacking skill: hacking() / 4

 - tripwire L4 => target gets 1 damage because they tripped badly (oh nose).
 - reloc L5 => clears enemy combat stack
 - overload L6 => target erhält schaden basierend auf hacking (je besser der gegner hacken kann desto mehr schaden)
 - spoof L7 => makes enemy attack a friend
 - smartgun L8 => unload the targets weapon
 - sidechannel L9 => nuyen werden geklaut
 - reboot L14 => target player freezes for attacker hacking seconds.
 - essence L10 => target erhält schaden basierend auf intelligence (je mehr int, je mehr damage)
 - preload L18 => target uses a random item on a random target
 - dos L24 => Ltarget player cannot hack anymore

### Combat math

Example combat between a beginner and a lamer

Lamer: 3 HP atk 2 dmg 1-2 def 1
beginner: 10 HP atk 2 dmg 1-3 def 1

if rand(0, atk) >= rand(0, def)
    dmg = rand(min, max) - armor~~
