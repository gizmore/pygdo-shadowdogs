##### Government

The four winds rule over the combat zone.
They are the humans who hold the highscores in ESL.

Each wind has 2 votes on polls, resulting in **8 votes**.

A special **3 votes** were gathered by a special player.
Thy once tricked Zeus, Alice and the winds and unlocked the first votes to the humans and citizens.
Thy also settled a contract with [ALICE](#ALICE).
This man is hence known as the Master of the Wind.

ALICE has **14 votes**,
as they represent the physics, math, time, randomness
the machines and robots and also all the free and commercial software alike.

Another **10 votes** go to the animals.
The insects, the birds, the mammals, the fish and the reptiles.

Moreover, **10 votes** go the plants growing.
The trees, the farn, the corals, the flowers and the herbs.

So in total there are **45 votes** for a perfect balance.
14 votes are enough to make a decision...

but wait!

Soon the humans demanded votes for all the citizens,
so any living creature can vote for the council votes,
which are another **4 votes**.

Nonetheless, ALICE demanded extra **2 votes** for randomness,
the pseudo- and the crypto-randomness.

Finally, **51** votes in total may occur,
which means 26 votes to execute a poll with *simple consent*.


#### Polls

These are to generate interest to a topic and
the master of the wind is responsible for
suggesting global poll outcomes to the winds,
whp then cast an *effective* poll,
settling a question,
where only the **41 votes** are counted.

Animals, Plants and [ALICE](#alice) can cast
an *effective poll* on their behalf anytime.
