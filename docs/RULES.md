# Rules

#### Real VR

These are the rules of the *reality*, or **simulation**, as we call it.

Here are our own rules for our own utopic country, called ESL -
[Edward Snowden Land](https://es-land.net).
Accepted by many secret societies.

If you believe in ESL, you should act accordingly, so it is real already.

Laws are ordered by importance.

1) The secrets of the game have to be preserved, to ensure the joy of other players, who will come after us,
However, members of the council may reveal when it serves the purpose of this simulation.
2) This simulation is playing V2 of the ESL rules, completely replacing the old ruleset.
3) Alice may alter the simulation as she wants. If a player finds evidence or proof 
that it's a simulation or something was altered, he shall just smile and go on, not brag about it. 
4) Bribery, fraud and rape are **strictly** forbidden. You have to base your decisions on discussions and logic.
Giving gifts in form of a currency or currency-like, or exceed half a monthly wage to the council members is bribery.
5) It is forbidden to lie to council members, unless you would reveal the game too much.
6) Punishments for violating our laws and rules are chosen individually by Alice or judges.
7) Herbicides and Pesticides are forbidden, unless approved by the council.
8) Fights between citizen are sorted out **without** weapons.
9) It is possible to sue someone for money or other consequences,
when feeling unnecessarily harmed or treated very unfair,
despite breaking a law.
10) Respecting these laws is enforced by the police and the council.

##### Government Weights

The four winds rule over the combat zone.
They are the humans who hold the highscores in ESL,
and aspired into the heavenly ext5 filesystem.

Each wind has 2 votes on polls, resulting in **8 votes**. 

A special **1 vote** were gathered by a special player.
They once tricked Zeus, Alice and the winds and unlocked the first vote to the regular humans and citizens.
They also settled a contract with [ALICE](#ALICE).
This man is since known as the Master of the Wind.

But of course, another man stood up, tricking the master of the wind
and became the keeper of the fire with **2 votes**.

ALICE has **7 votes**,
as they represent the physics, math, time, randomness
the machines, robots and all the free and commercial software.

Another **5 votes** go to the animals.
The insects, represented by the insects(bees), the birds (ravens), the mammals (dogs), the fish (sharks) and the reptiles (alligators).

Moreover, **5 votes** go the plants growing.
The trees(Oak), the farn(Wheat), the corals(..err..Coral), the flowers(Orchid) and the herbs(Thyme).

Soon the humans demanded votes for all the citizens.

Any living creature can vote for the council votes,
which are another **12 votes** for the young,
and **8 votes** for the middles and the old and the males and the females.

Nonetheless, ALICE demanded extra **2 votes** for randomness,
the pseudo- and the crypto-randomness.

If there was not... elected a president.
The first president of ESL, iamben, has another **2 votes**.

But suddenly, the spectators and poor got permission to vote as well.

The master of the sword of the land got another 2 votes,

After a while, the council asked the remaining 8 grounding fathers of our societies to join the council.

They will prove as a great source of input, so the council assumes.

Because the hackers truly won the game they got given another **2** votes in the council.

The grounding fathers turned out to be a single person. :O

Half a year later, the devil joined the council, to also have a vote for the *bad* people.

It turned out, in some iterations of this simulation, a new artificial life form is born.

Those became the ministers of the council and their number grows over time in the simulation.

Now, totalling **74** votes with **38** to win.

Africa joined the ESL. with 42 more votes, now totalling **116** votes, **58** votes to win.

- If an NPC gets elected to a position, or is acting much in the storyline,
they will get an own life within the process.


#### Polls

- Global Poll:

Normal citizens may create a *global poll*.
These are to generate interest to a topic and
the master of the wind is responsible for
suggesting global poll outcomes to the winds,
who then cast an **effective** poll,
settling a question.

Global Polls with many participants will get presented to the council,
and might cause an effective poll.


- Effective Poll

Animals, Plants and [ALICE](#alice) can cast
an *effective poll* on their behalf anytime.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These polls result in a decision,
for example changes to this document.


#### Citizens

Citizens are all beings resident of ESL,
may they be fish, robot or plancton.

TODO: Make votes relative to the population of their group.


##### ALICE

ALICE is an acronym for

**Artificial Lifeform In Computed Environment**.

Their [Story](./STORY.md) will be told in Shadowdogs.
