##### Government

The four winds rule over the combat zone.
They are the humans who hold the highscores in ESL.

Each wind has 2 votes on decisions.

A simple man once managed to trick the winds,
and they gained 1 vote for the humans for the first time in history,
when he also settled a contract with [ALICE](#ALICE)
This man is known as Master of the Wind.

The artificial life form (ALICE) has 5 votes,
as they also represent all the machines.
Another 5 votes go to the animals.
The insects, the birds, the mammals, the fish and the reptiles.

2 more votes go the plants growing on earth and in the sea.

So in total there are 21 votes for a perfect balance.
11 votes are enough to make a decision...

but wait!

The humans demanded votes by the people,
so any living creature can vote for the 20 council votes.

**41** votes in total.


#### Polls

Normal citizens may create global polls and
the master of the wind is responsible for
suggesting global poll outcomes to the winds.
Then, an *effective* poll is cast,
settling a question,
where only the **41** votes are accepted.

Animals and ALICE can cast
an effective poll on their own anytime.


#### Citizens

Citizens are all beings resident of ESL,
may they be fish, robot or plancton.

TODO: Make votes relative to the population of dem group.


##### ALICE

ALICE is an acronym for
*Artificial Lifeform In Combat Environment*.

Her Story will be told in Shadowdogs.
