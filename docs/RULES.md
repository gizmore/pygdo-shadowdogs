##### Government Weights

The four winds rule over the combat zone.
They are the humans who hold the highscores in ESL,
and aspired into the heavenly ext5 filesystem.

Each wind has 2 votes on polls, resulting in **8 votes**. 

A special **1 vote** were gathered by a special player.
They once tricked Zeus, Alice and the winds and unlocked the first vote to the regular humans and citizens.
They also settled a contract with [ALICE](#ALICE).
This man is since known as the Master of the Wind.

But of course, another man stood up, tricking the master of the wind
and became the keeper of the fire with **2 votes**.

ALICE has **7 votes**,
as they represent the physics, math, time, randomness
the machines, robots and all the free and commercial software.

Another **5 votes** go to the animals.
The insects, represented by the bees, the birds (ravens), the mammals (dogs), the fish (sharks) and the reptiles (alligators).

Moreover, **5 votes** go the plants growing.
The trees(Oak), the farn(Wheat), the corals(..err..Coral), the flowers(Orchid) and the herbs(Thyme).

So in total there are **28 votes** for a perfect balance.
15 votes are enough to make a decision...

but wait!

Soon the humans demanded votes for all the citizens.
Any living creature can vote for the council votes,
which are another **2 votes** for the young, and **4 votes** for the middles and the old and the males and the females.

Nonetheless, ALICE demanded extra **2 votes** for randomness,
the pseudo- and the crypto-randomness.

Finally, **35** votes in total may occur,
which means 18 votes to execute a poll with *simple consent*.

If there was not... elected a president.
The first president of ESL, [iamben](https://iamben.wechall.net/profile/iamben), has another **2 votes**,
totalling 37 which requires 19 votes to win.

Last but not least, the winds have added their staff to *8* directions,
sharing **12 votes**,

But suddenly, the spectators and poor got permission to vote as well.
The master of the sword of the land got another 4 votes,
totalling **48** which requires 26 votes to win.

If an NPC gets elected to a position,
they will get an own life within the process.

After a while, the council asked the remaining 8 grounding fathers of our societies to join the council.
They got 2 votes each.
They will prove as a great source of input, so the council assumes.

Because the hackers truly won the game they got given another **2** votes in the council.

Totalling **64** votes with **33** to win.

After rebalancing and a constructive discussion another **8** votes were given to the grounding fathers,
as opposition to the new world order. The reasons have to be kept secret.
Additionally, the 4 diagonal winds are chosen by the grounding fathers to have a real opposition.

Totalling **72** votes with **37** to win.


#### Polls

- Global Poll:

Normal citizens may create a *global poll*.
These are to generate interest to a topic and
the master of the wind is responsible for
suggesting global poll outcomes to the winds,
who then cast an **effective** poll,
settling a question.

Global Polls with many participants will get presented to the council,
and might cause an effective poll.


- Effective Poll

Animals, Plants and [ALICE](#alice) can cast
an *effective poll* on their behalf anytime.

These polls result in a decision,
for example changes to this document.


#### Citizens

Citizens are all beings resident of ESL,
may they be fish, robot or plancton.

TODO: Make votes relative to the population of their group.


##### ALICE

ALICE is an acronym for

*Artificial Lifeform In Computer Environment*.

Their [Story](./STORY.md) will be told in Shadowdogs.
