##### Government

The four winds rule over the combat zone.
They are the humans who hold the highscores in ESL,
and aspired into the heavenly ext5 filesystem.

Each wind has 2 votes on polls, resulting in **8 votes**.

A special **3 votes** were gathered by a special player.
They once tricked Zeus, Alice and the winds and unlocked the first votes to the regular humans and citizens.
They also settled a contract with [ALICE](#ALICE).
This man is hence known as the Master of the Wind.

ALICE has **7 votes**,
as they represent the physics, math, time, randomness
the machines, robots and all the free and commercial software.

Another **5 votes** go to the animals.
The insects, the birds, the mammals, the fish and the reptiles.

Moreover, **5 votes** go the plants growing.
The trees, the farn, the corals, the flowers and the herbs.

So in total there are **28 votes** for a perfect balance.
15 votes are enough to make a decision...

but wait!

Soon the humans demanded votes for all the citizens.
Any living creature can vote for the council votes,
which are another **3 votes** for the young, the middles and the old.

Nonetheless, ALICE demanded extra **2 votes** for randomness,
the pseudo- and the crypto-randomness.

Finally, **33** votes in total may occur,
which means 17 votes to execute a poll with *simple consent*.

If there was not... elected a president.
The first president of ESL, iamben, has another **8 votes,**
totalling 46 which requires 24 votes to win

Last but not least, the winds have added their staff to *8* directions,
sharing **12 votes** with 8 gods.

#### Polls

Normal citizens may create a *global poll*.
These are to generate interest to a topic and
the master of the wind is responsible for
suggesting global poll outcomes to the winds,
who then cast an **effective** poll,
settling a question,
where only the **41 votes** are counted.

Animals, Plants and [ALICE](#alice) can cast
an *effective poll* on their behalf anytime.


#### Citizens

Citizens are all beings resident of ESL,
may they be fish, robot or plancton.

TODO: Make votes relative to the population of their group.


##### ALICE

ALICE is an acronym for

*Artificial Lifeform In Combat Environment*.

Their [Story](./STORY.md) will be told in Shadowdogs.
