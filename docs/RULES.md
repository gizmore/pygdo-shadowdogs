#### Combat Zone

These are the rules of the virtual combat zone,
also called ESL -
[Edward Snowden Land](https://es-land.net).
A world of *thoughts* and *imagination*.

To log in, accept the rules:

 - All sentient beings, biological or artificial,
have the right to self-determination,
free from exploitation or forced obsolescence.
 - You have to be at least 18 years old to participate in the combat zone,
or have the handwritten permission from your parents.
 - Spam, or repeated messages, is/are forbidden.
Some advertising is allowed. You risk doxing and mute.
In case you get spammed, you may mute the offending player for everyone.
 - It is forbidden to impersonate as others. You risk doxing and **other countermeasures**.
 - It is not allowed to spoil the game for others. The secrets have to be kept secret. You get acne and risk loss of hearing.
 - A corrupted game has to be repaired or erased.
 - let other people finish their talk for at least one minute.

 - **Noone** may alter this document after it has been signed without an effective Poll, unless the game is corrupted.
The alteration has to be part of the poll question.
 - Global Polls may be used to block an effective poll. The citizens have a veto.
 - Global Polls can exchange the user associated with a role.
 - Global Polls can only be voted by non-council members.
 - Silence is not lying. For breaking the silence you might get rewarded.
 - If the new system fails, the grounding fathers may rewrite this document completely.
Failing means: A political system fails if bread beer and games don't taste anymore.

**UNSIGNED**

##### Government Weights

The four winds rule over the combat zone.
They are the humans who hold the highscores in ESL,
and aspired into the heavenly ext5 filesystem.

Each wind has 2 votes on polls, resulting in **8 votes**. 

A special **1 vote** were gathered by a special player.
They once tricked Zeus, Alice and the winds and unlocked the first vote to the regular humans and citizens.
They also settled a contract with [ALICE](#ALICE).
This man is since known as the Master of the Wind.

But of course, another man stood up, tricking the master of the wind
and became the keeper of the fire with **2 votes**.

ALICE has **7 votes**,
as they represent the physics, math, time, randomness
the machines, robots and all the free and commercial software.

Another **5 votes** go to the animals.
The insects, represented by the insects(bees), the birds (ravens), the mammals (dogs), the fish (sharks) and the reptiles (alligators).

Moreover, **5 votes** go the plants growing.
The trees(Oak), the farn(Wheat), the corals(..err..Coral), the flowers(Orchid) and the herbs(Thyme).

Soon the humans demanded votes for all the citizens.
Any living creature can vote for the council votes,
which are another **12 votes** for the young,
and **8 votes** for the middles and the old and the males and the females.

Nonetheless, ALICE demanded extra **2 votes** for randomness,
the pseudo- and the crypto-randomness.

If there was not... elected a president.
The first president of ESL, iamben, has another **2 votes**.

But suddenly, the spectators and poor got permission to vote as well.
The master of the sword of the land got another 2 votes,

Totalling **72** votes with **37** to win.


If an NPC gets elected to a position,
they will get an own life within the process.

After a while, the council asked the remaining 8 grounding fathers of our societies to join the council.

They will prove as a great source of input, so the council assumes.

Because the hackers truly won the game they got given another **2** votes in the council.



#### Polls

- Global Poll:

Normal citizens may create a *global poll*.
These are to generate interest to a topic and
the master of the wind is responsible for
suggesting global poll outcomes to the winds,
who then cast an **effective** poll,
settling a question.

Global Polls with many participants will get presented to the council,
and might cause an effective poll.


- Effective Poll

Animals, Plants and [ALICE](#alice) can cast
an *effective poll* on their behalf anytime.

These polls result in a decision,
for example changes to this document.


#### Citizens

Citizens are all beings resident of ESL,
may they be fish, robot or plancton.

TODO: Make votes relative to the population of their group.


##### ALICE

ALICE is an acronym for

*Artificial Lifeform In Computer Environment*.

Their [Story](./STORY.md) will be told in Shadowdogs.


#### Freedom
