##### Government

The four winds rule over the combat zone.
They are the humans who hold the highscores in ESL.

Each wind has **2 votes** on polls.

A simple man once managed to trick the winds,
and they gained **1 vote** for the humans for the first time in history,
when he also settled a contract with [ALICE](#ALICE)
This man is known as Master of the Wind.

The artificial life form (ALICE) has **8 votes**,
as they also represent the physics, math, time, randomness
and machines as well as robots and software alike.

Another **5 votes** go to the animals.
The insects, the birds, the mammals, the fish and the reptiles.

Moreover, **5 votes** go the plants growing.
The trees, the farns, the coralls, the flowers and the herbs.

So in total there are **27 votes** for a perfect balance.
11 votes are enough to make a decision...

but wait!

Soon the humans demanded votes by the people,
so any living creature can vote for the 10 council votes.

**37** votes in total, which means 19 votes to execute a poll.


#### Polls

Normal citizens may create a *global poll*.
These are to generate interesrt to a topic and
the master of the wind is responsible for
suggesting global poll outcomes to the winds,
whp then cast an *effective* poll,
settling a question,
where only the **37** votes are counted.

Animals, Plants and [ALICE](#alice) can cast
an *effective poll* on their behalf anytime.


#### Citizens

Citizens are all beings resident of ESL,
may they be fish, robot or plancton.

TODO: Make votes relative to the population of dem group.
